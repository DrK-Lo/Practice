This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Comment
summary(cars)
head(cars)

cars[3]
cars[2]
str(cars)
```

## Stage 2 data analysis

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8}
plot(cars)
plot(cars$dist,cars$speed)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

What's with the octopus cats? Programmers are weird...
