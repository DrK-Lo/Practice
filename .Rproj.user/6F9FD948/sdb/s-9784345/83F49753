Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\n#Comment\nsummary(cars)\nhead(cars)\ncars[1]\n```\n\n## Stage 2 data analysis\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8}\nplot(cars)\nplot(cars$dist,cars$speed)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
